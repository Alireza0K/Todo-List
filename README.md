# Todo List
## What is Todo list

This app helps you list your daily tasks or anything you want to do, this project is an offline to-do list which means your to-do list is safe So don't worry about
leaked your data.


## Now what does the Todo list do for me?
1. In the Todo list I created, you can create different modes for different modes. And put the tasks related to that mod in it.
2. You can create an account and log in and add your tasks and mods.

3. These repositories are built with php Laravel, so if you are familiar with this beautiful language, you can develop it for yourself.

4. this todo list is offline that means you dont need to online your daily task, then its secure.
